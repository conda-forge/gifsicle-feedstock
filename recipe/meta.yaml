  summary: Create, manipulate, and optimize GIF images and animations

  description: |
    Gifsicle manipulates GIF image files. Depending on command line 
    options, it can merge several GIFs into a GIF animation; explode 
    an animation into its component frames; change individual frames 
    in an animation; turn interlacing on and off; add transparency; add 
    delays, disposals, and looping to animations; add and remove comments; 
    flip and rotate; optimize animations for space; change images' 
    colormaps; and other things.
